        "On `poker.stackexchange.com`, find the **frequent** tag such that the posts it appears have the lowest average score. A tag is considered frequent if it appears in at least 50 posts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:** Say you have three frequent tags `<a>`, `<b>`, and `<c>`, such that they appear in the set of posts `A`, `B`, and `C`, respectively. Note that `A`, `B`, and `C` may not necessarily be disjoint since a tag may appear in multiple posts. You have to look at the average scores of `A`, `B` and `C`, see which set has the lowest, and report the tag `<a>`, `<b>`, or `<c>` that belongs to such set. For instance, if the average scores are `AVG(A) = 13`, `AVG(B) = 15`, `AVG(C) = 12`, then tag `<c>` is the tag we're looking for, since `C` has the lowest average score. You should report it without the `<`, `>` characters, i.e. just `c`.\n",
