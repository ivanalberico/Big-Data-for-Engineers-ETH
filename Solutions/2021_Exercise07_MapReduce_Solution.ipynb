    "## 0. The two APIs for MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce provides two different interfaces: the **native MapReduce API** and the **Streaming API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The native MapReduce API is equivalent to the one seen in class. To use it, the user has to write two Java classes: one for the Mapper function and one for the Reducer function. Just like in the logical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Mapper function takes a KeyValue pair and emits zero or more KeyValue pairs;\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function map(key, value)\n",
    "  // Do some work\n",
    "  emit(someKey, someValue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- and the Reducer function takes a key and a collection of values, and emits zero or more KeyValue pairs (usually one). \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function reduce(key, values[])\n",
    "  // Do some work\n",
    "  emit(key, aggregatedValue)\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Streaming API is usually slower, but allows users to write the Mapper and the Reducer functions in any language — even different languages.\n",
    "To use the API we need to write two functions, a mapper and a reducer. In this case, however, the programs will directly read the KV pairs as a sequence of lines from standard input and write the resulting KV pairs to standard output.\n",
    "The streaming API will take care of all the parallelization, the shuffling and everything else required.\n",
    "Since the operations are done using the standard input and standard output, there are two differences with the logical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The KV pairs are not independently processed, but read all **sequentially** from standard input.\n",
    "2. The reducer task does not receive a key with a list of values, but the **ordered list** of KV pairs (one per line). Therefore, the reducer must therefore implement itself the logic for handling a new key. "

    "### 1.1 Create the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you are an expert with Azure! Today, we are going to create an HDInsight cluster running Hadoop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** we want you to use a small but real cluster for running HBase rather than a single machine. But, these clusters burn Azure credit very quickly—the cheapest configuration consumes roughly **2 CHF per hour**, which is a lot relative to your overall credit—so it is very important for you to **delete your cluster once you are done.** Luckily, it is possible to keep your data intact when you delete a cluster, and see it again when you recreate it; we will touch upon this in the process. Now, let's start. Those steps are very similar to the HDFS cluster we create on week 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Azure portal click the **\"Create a resource\"** button on the left, type **\"hdinsight\"** in the search box, and select **\"Azure HDInsight\"** and click **\"Create\"**. HDInsight is Microsoft's cloud service which wraps Hadoop, HBase, Spark and other Big Data technologies; read more [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the **\"Basics\"** tab, choose a subscription and **create a new resource group** (say \"exercise7\"). Pick a name for your cluster, select **UK South** as the region, **Hadoop** as the cluster type. Then, setup the cluster login username and password, as well as the SSH username.\n",
    "![basics](https://bigdataforengineers2021.blob.core.windows.net/exercise07/basics.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next, we need to configure the **\"Storage\"** tab. The canonical way would be to use an HDFS cluster as a storage layer for a Hadoop cluster, but we will be using the Blob service of Windows Azure Storage for this purpose. This has a significant advantage of allowing you to delete your HBase cluster without losing the data: you can recreate the cluster using the same Azure Storage Account and the same container and you will see the same data. This is useful, for example, if you don't have time to finish this exercise in one sitting: you can just delete your cluster, recreate it later, and continue your work. Azure storage is selected by default (see the screenshot).  \n",
    "To setup your Hadoop cluster for the first time, in **\"Primary storage account\"** click **\"Create new\"** and specify a name. Leave everything else as it is and click \"Next\".\n",
    "**Important**: if you are recreating your Hadoop cluster and want to see the existing data, then choose **\"Select existing\"** and set the container name to the one that you used last time—by default Azure generates a new container name every time you create a cluster, which then points to a different container. The container name can be found in \"Storage account - containers\".\n",
    "![storage](https://bigdataforengineers2021.blob.core.windows.net/exercise07/storage.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the \"Security + networking\" tab do not choose anything, just click \"Next: Configuration + pricing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now we need to choose the configuration of the nodes in our HBase cluster. Let's choose **2 Head nodes** of size **D3 v2**, and **4 Worker nodes** of size **D3 v2** (see the screenshot). Click **\"Review + create\"**.\n",
    "![pricing](https://bigdataforengineers2021.blob.core.windows.net/exercise07/pricing.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the last step, \"Summary\", check if the settings are as you intend. These clusters are expensive, so it is worth checking the price estimate at this step: for me it is 1.74 CHF/hour; if your price is larger than this, check your node sizes and counts. When done, initiate the cluster creation by clicking \"Create\". The process will take time, around 15—25 minutes."

Windows doesn't have it by default (although Windows 10 does since recently), but you can use one of the browser-based options described next, or the other option is to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).\n",
    "1. **In your browser:**\n",
    "  1. Use the **Azure Cloud Shell**. Click on the Cloud Shell icon at the top of Azure Dashboard toolbar. It will request your approval for creating a Storage Account required for the shell; agree to it.\n",
    "  1. Use a **terminal on Jupyter**. In your [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com) tab, click \"My Projects\" in the upper-left corner of the page. Then, select any project and click \"Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal of choice, run the following (this command with everything filled-in is also available on the Azure page of your cluster, if you click \"Secure Shell (SSH)\"): \n",
    "\n",
    "`ssh ssh_user_name@cluster_name-ssh.azurehdinsight.net`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this command, `ssh_user_name` is the \"ssh username\" that you have chosen in the first step of creating the cluster, and `cluster_name` also comes from that form. Note that the cluster name has to be suffixed with `-ssh`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If after running the `ssh` command you see a message similar to this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Welcome to Hadoop on HDInsight.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting\n",
    "Some issues may arise while creating your HBase cluster. Here are some common issues that we experienced:\n",
    "1. *StorageAccountAlreadyExists* : Make sure to use a unique name while creating a new storage account. The portal does not check for this while in the creation panel but only on validation and an error will arise. This also holds for cluster names.\n",
    "1. *The ssh connection does not work* : Use the password that you provided at creation. If you can't retrieve it, you can reset the password in the ssh+keys panel of your Hbase cluster. Also if you are recreating a new cluster, use a different name as your past created cluster. Otherwise, this may create a conflict in your local *known_hosts* configuration file.\n",

    "### 1.3 Writing the mapper and the reducer functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a MapReduce job we need of course a mapper function and a reducer. Usually to run natively on Hadoop we need to write our mapper and reducer as classes in Java, but to make the development easier and less cumbersome we are going to use the **Hadoop streaming API**.  \n",
    "This wonderful API allows the developers to write code in any language and integrate it seamlessly with the MapReduce framework.  \n",
    "We just need to provide 2 scripts—one for the mapper, one for the reducer—and let them read the KeyValues from `stdin` (the default input stream) and write them to `stdout` (the default output stream). Hadoop will take care of parallelization, the sort step and everything else required.  \n",
