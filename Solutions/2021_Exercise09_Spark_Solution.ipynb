    "Now, you will get to write some queries yourself on a larger dataset. You will be using the [language confusion dataset](http://lars.yencken.org/datasets/languagegame/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a little bit different, in that it is part of a small project you will be doing over the following 3 weeks to compare Spark, Spark with DataFrames/SQL, and Sparksoniq. You will hear more about it in the coming weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from that, you will have to submit the results of this exercise to Moodle to obtain the weekly bonus. You will need four things:\n",
    "- The query you wrote\n",
    "- Something related to its output (which you will be graded on)\n",
    "- The time it took you to write it\n",
    "- The time it took you to run it\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have observed in the sample queries above, the time a job took to run is displayed on the rightmost column of its ouptut. If it consists of several stages, however, you will need the sum of them. The easiest thing is if you just take the execution time of the whole query:\n",

    "Of course, you will not be evaluated on the time it took you to write the queries (nor on the time it took them to run), but this is useful to us in order to measure the increase in performance when using Sparksoniq. There is a cell that outputs the time you started working before every query. Use this if you find it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you can chose to either set up a local Spark installation on your computer or use an Azure cluster as explained above. Both are fine, but a local installation really makes things easier to debug.\n",
